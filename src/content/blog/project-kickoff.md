# Hello World

This is the first post on the official Moyin portal. 
It is rendered directly from **Markdown**, ensuring optimal performance and SEO.

## The Vision

> "Creation is a dream that continues."

Moyin aims to bridge the gap between traditional Visual Novel engines and the new wave of **Generative AI**.
By providing a "Dumb Pipe" backend and a "Think Client" frontend, we empower creators to orchestrate complex narratives without getting bogged down in server management.

### Key Features
*   **Astro + Vue**: High performance portal.
*   **LLM Protocol**: Standardized JSON schema for game turns.
*   **Cross Platform**: Web, iOS, and Electron.
